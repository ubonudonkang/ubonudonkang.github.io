# Ubon Udonkang · Portfolio v6

**Live site:** https://ubonudonkang.github.io

A static site served by GitHub Pages from the root of `main`. There is no build step: edit the HTML, CSS and JS directly.

## Publishing changes

Work on a branch, open a pull request, and merge it. GitHub Pages redeploys `main` automatically, usually within a minute or two.

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push -u origin my-change
```

Never force-push to `main`: it rewrites history and can wipe out other changes.

## Common edits

- **Contact form:** posts to Formspree form `xdaqwayj` (see `contact/index.html`).
- **Portrait:** replace `img/ubon-udonkang.jpg` with another photo of the same name. A 4:5 portrait works best.
- **AMS documents:** add a PDF to `docs/ams/`, then give its row in `project-ams/index.html` a `data-pdf` path and a `View` button, like the Data Dictionary row.
- **Testimonials:** short quotes live in the home page carousel. The full recommendations are on the About page.

## Design notes

- White editorial layout: Instrument Serif headings, Inter body text, JetBrains Mono labels.
- One accent colour, signature blue `#1F3BD6`. Stamp red is used only on the "Approved" and "Delivered" stamps.
- The dock is the main navigation on every page. Its magnification only runs with a mouse.
- Respects reduced motion, reduced transparency and higher-contrast settings.
